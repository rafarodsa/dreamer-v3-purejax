    Sample a batch of trajectories from the buffer.

    Args:
        state: The buffer's state.
        rng_key: Random key.
        batch_size: Batch size of sampled experience.
        sequence_length: Length of trajectory to sample.
        period: The period refers to the interval between sampled sequences. It serves to regulate
            how much overlap there is between the trajectories that are sampled. To understand the
            degree of overlap, you can calculate it as the difference between the
            sample_sequence_length and the period. For instance, if you set period=1, it means that
            trajectories will be sampled uniformly with the potential for any degree of overlap. On
            the other hand, if period is equal to sample_sequence_length - 1, then trajectories can
            be sampled in a way where only the first and last timesteps overlap with each other.
            This helps you control the extent of overlap between consecutive sequences in your
            sampling process.

    Returns:
        A batch of experience.
